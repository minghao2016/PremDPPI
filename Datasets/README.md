## Terms in file S8641.txt

<font size=4>

Target UniprotID: The identifier of target protein given by Protein knowledgebase (UniProtKB).

Interactor UniprotID: The identifier of interactor protein given by Protein knowledgebase (UniProtKB).

Target_Mutation_unp: The mutation occurs in target protein.

PDBfile: Ccoordinate file of a protein structure.

Partner1: The chain of target protein.

Partner2: The chain of interactor protein.

Mutated Chain: Protein chain with mutation.

Mutation_PDB: The first character is one letter amino acid code for the wild-type residue, the second to penultimate characters indicate residue number, and the final character indicates the mutant amino acid.

Disrupting: Experimental results if a mutation disrupts protein-protein interaction.

Interface: Whether the mutation occurs at the protein-protein binding interface (yes/no). The interface residue is defined if residue solvent accessibility in the complex is lower than in the corresponding unbound partner.

PremDPPI: Predicted results if a mutation disrupts protein-protein interaction.

PremDPPI(CV3): "Leave-one-structure-out" cross-validation results.
